Welcome to linux hands on

&& after one command execution other command will 

by using curl we can see that total scripr
curl: check url
curl https://get.docker.com | bash && docker version

here what ever output we get from first paramter it will passthat output another parameter.
cat /etc/passwd | cut -d ":" -f 1
cat it will read the data and that data out put passto next param cut delimited by : we are getting the first filed

Variable declaration:
types of variable declaration
a=20
echo $a
echo "$a"
echo "${a}"

here single quote for string

first script
#! /bin/bash
echo "first script"
i=$@
while [ $i -lt 6]
do
echo " i am $i"
sleep 2
i=$(( $i + 1 ))
done


chmod +x test.sh
./test.sh 100
hete $@ is used for taking the user values as a input
===================
****By using scripting we need to create a file in every 5 secondss3 bucket in aws

for this we need aws cli
apt-get install unzip paste the below command

$ curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
unzip awscliv2.zip
sudo ./aws/install

aws --version
aws-cli/2.0.56 Python/3.7.3 Linux/4.4.0-1113-aws exe/x86_64.ubuntu.16
aws configure
aws s3 ls
NOw we need to configure our aws

buk=$(aws s3 ls | cut -d " " -f 3)
#code
#! /bin/bash
i=0
while [ $i -lt 3]
do
date > file$i s3://bucketname
echo "uploading file$i"
sleep 2
i=$(( $i + 1 ))
done

====================================================
another realtime
need to check user exist or not && if user not exist create it && set random password at first login
to check users /etc/passwd

read is used to enter command side input values
to delete a user userdel -r username
--now we need to learn operators
learn this
https://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix/unix-basic-operators.htm
-z is check userinput is empty or not(note it only for strings)
***** linux very important params to know
$?
$@
$*
$#

$? is used for previously executed command succees or not if it sucees it will return 0 
echo $?
